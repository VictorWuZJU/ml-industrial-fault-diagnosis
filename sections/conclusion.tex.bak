\section{Conclusion and Future Work}
This work has introduced a unified formulation and implementation route for machine-learning-based industrial fault diagnosis that couples a mathematical model of the diagnosis pipeline with an explicit real-time execution scheme. By expressing the system as a sequence of operators acting on multichannel windows, from yk to Yw, ϕ(Yw), gθ(z˜w) and finally to alarm decisions, the approach clarifies how windowing, feature extraction, classification and decision logic interact under sampling and timing constraints. On top of this structure, a streaming algorithm was derived, together with a simple timing inequality that links feature-extraction and inference costs to the stride S and sampling period Ts.
Experimental results on public bearing datasets and an industrial pump-line application show that a compact 1D-CNN instantiation of the framework can achieve higher macro F1 scores than conventional feature-based classifiers and deeper baselines, while still satisfying real-time requirements on an edge device with comfortable margin. Robustness tests under noise, missing samples and cross-domain transfer indicate that the proposed configuration retains useful performance when conditions deviate from the nominal training regime, although performance degradation is still evident in the presence of strong domain shifts.
Future work will focus on extending the operator-based model to heterogeneous sensor suites and digital-twin interfaces, integrating domain adaptation mechanisms to mitigate distribution shift across assets and operating modes, and coupling the current architecture with explainability tools so that high-confidence decisions can be related to physically meaningful signal structures. A further line of work is the joint design of sensing and learning, including adaptive sampling and sensor placement strategies that explicitly account for the latency and resource constraints captured by the proposed timing model.
